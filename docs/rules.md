   1. The selection of images for the site is carried out by moderators. When making a decision, the moderator follows the criteria established by the administration for selecting images. The final decision to publish or reject an image is made automatically based on the opinions of several moderators.
   2. Rejected images are accompanied by an indication of the reason for rejection, which is displayed in the history of image changes in the user gallery

By submitting your images for inclusion on the Website, you transfer to the Website your non-exclusive proprietary rights to them (the right to make public or allow public disclosure of the image in any form) for any non-commercial use of the images within the Website. All manipulations with the images legally (at the author's request, with the author's consent) published on the Site, such as transferring to other sections, removal from the Site, etc., are the exclusive prerogative of the administration and those authorized by the administration. Withdrawal of images from the site is not welcome, removal in this case is made only if there are valid reasons.

3. Criteria for selecting images
   1. We are interested in images that reflect the history of the place and society with the exception of:
      1. Low-quality, when it is not clear what is shown in the picture
      2. Family photos, portraits of people and animals without clear attribution to the location (except for genre scenes that convey the spirit of the time)
      3. Which dimensions are less than 700 pixels on the larger side (margins, if any, do not count).
      4. With large size (more than 10% of the image area) copyrights and non-original captions,
      5. Photographs taken after 2000 and other images created after 1980;
      6. Over 50 megabytes in size;
      7. Small size/low quality, mechanically "stretched" in a graphic editor to 700 pixels or more;
      8. Images of museum and exhibition exhibits (paintings, sculptures, models, machines, engineering systems, mechanisms, automotive and motor vehicles and similar objects);
   2. Images without coordinates are accepted into the "Where is it?" section if the user specifies as the minimum information about the shooting point:
      1. For images of urban environment - country of shooting
      2. For images of separate architectural objects, buildings, landscapes, non-architectural objects - country, region, nearest settlement.
   3. Pages from newspapers, magazines, and other publications where an image accompanies text (except for the title of the photo) will be rejected. The image should be uploaded separately from the text, and the text, if it is important and is a description of the image, should be given in the description field. The text printed (written) over the image should not be deleted - moderators will decide on each such photo separately.
   4. "Splices" of photos taken from different points and/or directions will be rejected. "Splices" of photos taken at different times will also be rejected.
   5. Pictures in which the faces of the persons depicted are blurred, "cut out", replaced by ovals or otherwise "photoshopped" will be considered deliberately defaced and not worthy of publication on the site. If the user does not want to show his/her face, faces of his/her relatives or acquaintances - he/she should refrain from publishing such photos.
   6. Users uploading images are not expected to intentionally "age" images or remove any details that clearly identify the image as post-2000. Such actions cannot be called anything other than intentional falsification. In case such an act is detected, the falsified images will be deleted immediately.

4. Text content
   1. Text posted in comments to the images and in the Forum (hereinafter "Messages") serve to discuss the images and other information posted by users on the site.
   2. Messages are prohibited:
      1. Personal and public insults, pointing out and discussing physical and mental aspects of any site user, as well as personas in the images, including political figures (no time limit);
      2. Statements that explicitly or implicitly incite racial, national and/or religious discord and intolerance, as well as hurt the religious, national and other feelings of any visitor to the site;
      3. Use of obscene (profane) words and expressions, as well as symbols replacing them.
   3. Any opinion posted is the personal opinion of the visitor. Posts on behalf of any group of people (nation, nationality) or state are not permitted unless the speaker is explicitly authorized to do so.
   4. It is not allowed to publish deliberately false messages aimed at misleading site visitors.
   5. No personal correspondence is allowed. Use email for this purpose.
   6. It is not allowed to publish messages that have little meaning and carry no useful information ("flooding"), including:
      1. Messages like "+1", "I agree", "I see", etc.; a stream of messages of short phrases that can be combined into one and sent as one message;
      2. Reports the number of images the user has on the site according to some criteria;
      3. Information about the location of users or persons in the images;
      4. Comments aimed solely at attracting users' attention to their images, including the unjustified use of comments instead of the "Note" field when uploading.
   7. Political and ideological discussions are forbidden on the site. Active participants and provocateurs of such discussions are put on indefinite premoderation.
   8. Links to third-party sites with restricted access (e.g. requiring registration to view them) are not permitted in the text of messages.
   9. In order to avoid duplication of discussions, before writing a message, it is recommended to read earlier discussions on the given topic, at least - to look through other discussions of the same section, as well as to use search engines (Yandex, Google). In case of systematic duplication of discussions penalties are applied to the user.
   10. It is recommended to reply in the same language as the original message, unless otherwise indicated by the author of the original message.
   11. Moderators have the right to delete any posts without giving a reason.
   12. For violation of paragraphs 4.1-4.10 the user may be subject to penalties in the form of pre-moderation of messages or transfer to read mode for a limited period or indefinitely.

5. Rules of image naming
   1. Currently, when you upload an image to the site, the Title field automatically shows the name of the corresponding file on your computer. It should be replaced with the name of the image.
   2. The names of images are given in the national language of the country where the image was taken or in English. The nationality of the territory is determined at the time the image is uploaded or at the time the image is created.
      It is allowed to name images on the territory of the former USSR in Russian.
   3. The names shall be written in lower case letters. Capital letters are used in cases stipulated by the rules of the respective language.
   4. The names are written according to the rules of modern orthography.
   5. The title of the image is the title of the page, no dot is put at the end of the title.
   6. The title of the image should preferably be brief, no more than 120 characters. It is logical to place long descriptions and lists of the objects shown in the image in the description field.
   7. Date of photography is not included in the title. The years of photography are indicated in the appropriate field, more precise date can be specified in the description to the image
   8. Regions defined automatically by the system are not indicated in the name of the image. The city name is indicated if it was different at the time of shooting than it is now.
   9. Names like: "My yard", "I am near my house" are unacceptable. Also unacceptable are vulgar place names such as "Piglet", "On Broadway", "Shanghai", etc. Such "folk" names, if desired, should be given in the footnote box.
   10. Names of streets and other objects should be given as of the date of image. It is permissible to give the current name in parentheses if it differs from the previous one. In cases where the year of the photo is unknown and the name was changed within the supposed period, write both names, e.g. for a photo taken from 1930 to 1940: Vorobyovy (Leninskie) hory.
   11. Do not disregard author titles, of course, if they
       - are known;
       - are not indecent;
       - do not contain obvious errors and do not contradict the historical truth.

6. Indication of sources
   1. The site administration is very interested in the fact that users in good faith indicated in the appropriate column the source from which the images were borrowed. In the case where the source is not indicated, or indicated knowingly falsely, and the legal owner of the site presents claims, paragraph 1.16 of these Rules comes into force. A dishonest attitude towards the indication of the source of the image(s) may lead to civil or criminal liability in accordance with the current legislation.

7. Requirements for nicknames (nicknames, nicks) and usernames (avatars)
   1. The user has the right to register under his/her real name or choose a nickname or pseudonym which he/she will use for communication.
   2. The nickname must not be:
      1. Contain words, expressions, combinations of letters that are obviously interpreted as swearing, insults or profanity;
      2. Be similar to the nicknames of administrators and moderators to the extent that other users would be misled.
   3. Usernames must not contain obscene (indecent) images that offend public morals and are contrary to generally accepted standards of morality. In case of failure to comply with these requirements, the site administration reserves the right to block the user's account before making changes to the nickname and/or the username.

8. Recommendations on editing uploaded photos (not obligatory, but desirable)
   1. Before uploading any image, it would be a good idea to pass it through a graphic editor (Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, XnView, etc.). In a matter of seconds, the image can be significantly improved by simple actions!
   2. For example, if there are brown spots in a black-and-white photo, they can be easily removed by bleaching.
   3. If the houses in the image "roll" to the right or to the left, it would be useful to align the image vertically.
   4. You can improve "cloudy", faded images by adding contrast and saturation.
   5. Color photos with distorted colors can be corrected with AutoTone and AutoColor.
   6. If an image is clearly defocused, it can be corrected using the "flip horizontal" function.
   7. You can also raise the sharpness slightly.
   8. Pre-processing is welcome if the original b/w photo is actually green-white, yellow-white or red-white.
   9. All of these manipulations can be mastered in one evening, and the end result is that you can improve your images not only for PastVu, but also just for yourself!
   10. As a word of caution: don't get carried away with improvement, remembering: the best is the enemy of the good! One more thing: this point is RECOMMENDATIONS, not binding.
