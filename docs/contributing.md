# Contributing to Docs

We welcome contributions to this documentation. Our documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusarus.io), a powerful open source documentation project written in JavaScript.

It's easy to get your development environment set up and if you plan to contribute regularly to our documentation, then we recommend you setup a [local development environment](#local-development) for the best results.

## Installation

### Local development

To set up a local development environment we recommend install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), and then running:

```console
nvm install
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

### Starting the development server

```console
yarn start
```

### Building the docs and serving them locally

```console
yarn build
yarn serve
```
