## Code of Conduct

We expect all project participants to follow [code of conduct](./dev/code-of-conduct)

## Development

We welcome any keen developer in helping us building the better PastVu! Any
contributions are welcome, no matter how big or small.

### Process

All development takes place in [PastVu GitHub repository](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu), allowing the repository tools to be used for issue tracking, pull requests, testing and release management.

All pull requests are checked by the continuous integration system which has a range of unit tests, style and lint tests, build tests.

### Where to start

If you are new to Open Source contributions, you may find those guides
useful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
* [GitHub manual on contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

If you've not contributed to PastVu before and would like to do so, the good starting point is a list of [good first
issues](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
each of them is relatively simple and will help you to familiarise with a
code. If you have questions, you may ask them in the issue comments, or in
[discussion board](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu/discussions).

You will need a local development environment to start work on the project,
see [Getting started](/dev/setup) development manual for details.
