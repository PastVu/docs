### Where to start

The good starting point is a list of [good first
issues](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22),
each of them is relatively simple and will help you to familiarise with a
code. If you have questions, you may ask them in the issue comments, or in
[discussion board](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu/discussions).

If you are new to contributing to open source project, you may find [this
